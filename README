Code Conventions
================

1. The main class will only contain top level code. This means that it should contain top level modules and the code necessary for interactions between them. Other main classes should only be used for testing purposes and should be clearly indicated for this purpose.

For example:

	public static void main (String[] args) {
		
		AClass a;
		BClass b;
		CClass c;
		
		a.generateData();
		b.modifyData(a.getData());
		c.displayData(b.getData());
		
	}
	
2. Modules should be organized into packages of related classes. These packages should be named appropriately. The package structure should accurately reflect our design choices in terms of abstraction.

For example:

Project
	
	Main.java

	Image
		Pixel.java
		...
		
	Gui
		Gui.java
		...
	
3. Coding Conventions

	a. Naming
		i. Package names will be entirely lowercase.
			e.g. test, gui, imagepreprocess
		ii. Class names will follow uppercase camelcase.
			e.g. public class Main, private class PixelArray
		iii. Variable names will follow lowercase camelcase and will accurately describe the variable's utility.
			e.g. int clusterCount, double neuralNetAccuracy
		iv. Constants will be entirely uppercase with underscores for seperating words.
			e.g. final double THRESHOLD, final int MAX_SIZE
		v. Single letter variables are discouraged and should only be used for iteration. 
		   Iteration through structures that have dimensionality should use x, y, z, etc.
		   i, j and k should be used otherwise.
